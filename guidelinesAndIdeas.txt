Ideas:
  - word embeddings
    -> map the word with a group ( maybe with a dictionary like structure that stores word - picture pair ), must be dynamic ( not statically mark the classes )
    -> word alteration troughout algorithm steps ( ex. from bird to an airplane )
  - work on getting harder dataset and solving it
  - show hierarchies inside a group ( for example: group all airplanes in the same group and then make hierarchies like: airplanes on the track, others in the sky etc.)
  - mushroom recognition - may be interesting to find a way to categorize this somehow ( life and death situation may be interesting )
  - some kind of graphical representation connecting various tensors that were taken from the DNN and the clustering data ( how it managed to separate them and things like that )
  - try with TSNE or some other feature selection algorithm
  - when presentation day comes: DRESS TO IMPRESS !!!
