- successfully installed Resnet framework for deep learning algorithms

- succesfully installed Torch framework that offers ML algorithms that utilize GPU (Lua language)

- succesfully extracted 2048 features for every image in given dataset

- created script for converting image files to .jpg and .png that Torch accepts


- NEXT MEETING TODO:
	- propose algorithms for unsupervised learning and image classification
	- implement proposed algorithms
	- compare and document results from each classification algorihm
